Objective: Make an OpenMRS Development ready Linux VM

Please follow the steps below:

Install VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
Install Vagrant: http://downloads.vagrantup.com/tags/v1.0.6

Pull the files 'bootstrap.sh' and 'Vagrantfile' from the repository and Put it in a folder.

From the command line, go to the folder where these both files are present. And Type 'vagrant 

provision'.

It will install all the required tools.

Have Fun! :)
